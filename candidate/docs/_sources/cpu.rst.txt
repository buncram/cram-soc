CPU
===



This `VexRiscv <https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv#vexriscv-architecture>`_ core provides the following bus interfaces:

- 64-bit AXI-4 instruction cache bus (read-only cached)
- Data bus crossbar

  - 0x60000000-7FFFFFFF: 32-bit AXI-4 data cache bus (r/w cached)
  - 0x40000000-4FFFFFFF: 32-bit AXI-lite peripheral bus (r/w uncached)
- All busses run at ACLK speed
- WFI signal is broken out to `wfi_active`
- `satp` signals broken out for `coreuser` interpretation

The core itself contains the following features:

- VexRiscv CPU (simple, in-order RV32-IMAC with pipelining)
- Static branch prediction
- 4k, 4-way D-cache
- 4k, 4-way I-cache
- MMU and 8-entry TLB
- AES instruction extensions
- Non-cached regions (used for I/O):

   - 0x40000000 - 5FFFFFFF
   - 0xA0000000 - FFFFFFFF

   - Any non-cached regions not routed through peripheral bus are internal to the core block
